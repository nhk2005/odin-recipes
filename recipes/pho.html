        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This South Vietnamese style pho brings comfort with every sip and slurp. It's a restorative, richly seasoned broth ladled over rice noodles and thinly sliced beef and served with a host of crisp, tangy, spicy, sweet, and fragrant garnishes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The version you see here has been adapted slightly from LETT101's original with insights from All recipes friend and Vietnamese cookbook author Andrea Nguyen and tested in our All recipes test kitchens. We specified the amount of ginger and charred the onion and ginger before adding them to the broth. "That partially cooks those aromatics and kind of mellows things out," says Nguyen. "It's the backbone of the broth."
        </p>
        <p>
            This version also calls for beef soup bones rather than beef knuckle, which can be harder to find, and is served with the more traditional hoisin sauce rather than the plum sauce mentioned in the original.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>beef soup bones</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>onions</li>
            <li>ginger root</li>
            <li>beef oxtail</li>
            <li>white radish</li>
            <li>cinnamon stick</li>
            <li>whole cloves</li>
            <li>black peppercorns</li>
            <li>white sugar</li>
            <li>fish sauce</li>
            <li>frozen beef sirloin</li> 
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the beef bones in a 9-quart (or larger) pot. Season with salt, and fill pot with 2 gallons of water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for about 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, preheat broiler. Put onions and unpeeled ginger on a foil-lined, 10x15-inch roasting pan. Broil 4 to 5 inches from heat until onion and ginger are charred, 10 to 15 minutes. Cool slightly. Chop onions. Peel and slice ginger.</li>
            <li>Skim fat from surface of broth, and add oxtail, daikon, and charred onions. Tie anise, cinnamon stick, cloves, peppercorns and charred ginger in a square of cheesecloth; add to broth. Stir in sugar, fish sauce, and remaining 2 tsp. salt. Simmer over medium-low heat at least 4 hours (the longer, the better). Strain broth. Discard spices and bones. Reserve meat from bones for other uses, if desired. Taste broth and add additional salt as needed. Chill overnight.</li>
            <li>Skim fat from top of chilled broth. Bring broth to a boil; reduce heat and keep hot until ready to serve.</li>
            <li>Cook rice noodles in boiling water according to package directions until soft, but not mushy. Cut sirloin into paper-thin slices.</li>
            <li>Divide noodles among bowls (1 1/2 cups per bowl). Top each with a few raw sirloin slices. Ladle boiling broth into bowls to cook beef and cover noodles.</li>
        </ol>
